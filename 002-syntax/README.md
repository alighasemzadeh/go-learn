# Syntax

# In Go Language you don't need to add `;` end of each line  , If you `Enter` it means you want to write new command.

# But If you want to write all codes in one line you have to use `;` end of each command.
```go
package main; import ("fmt"); func main() { fmt.Println("Hello World!");}
```
